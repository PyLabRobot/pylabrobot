ResourceStack
=============

`ResourceStack` groups multiple resources into a single unit that can grow along
the x, y or z axis. The accompanying tutorial notebook demonstrates how to use
stacks to organize plates and lids during automated workflows.

See :class:`~pylabrobot.resources.resource_stack.ResourceStack` for the API reference.
