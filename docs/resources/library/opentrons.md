> Opentrons Labworks, Inc. (or Opentrons) is a biotechnology company that manufactures liquid handling robots that use open-source software, which at one point used open-source hardware but no longer does.

We support Opentrons tip racks in PLR. See the definitions below.

Unfortunately, most of the other labware is missing information that is needed in PLR to get accurate and autonomous systems to work. Please refer to the other pages in this guide from labware made by other manufacturers.
