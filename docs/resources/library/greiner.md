> Greiner Bio-One (GBO) is a global life-science and medical-technology company that designs, manufactures, and distributes high-quality plastic consumables and labware for research, diagnostics, and clinical applications. Founded in 1963 (originally as Greiner Labortechnik) in Nürtingen, Germany — where it produced the first plastic petri dishes — the company rebranded as Greiner Bio-One in 2000 and has since grown into a multinational supplier serving over 100 countries.
> GBO operates across three main divisions — Preanalytics, BioScience, and Sterilization — covering sample collection, cell / tissue culture, high-throughput screening plates, and sterilization services. As part of the Greiner AG group (wholly family-owned), Greiner Bio-One leverages decades of manufacturing expertise to support biomedical research, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical workflows worldwide.
