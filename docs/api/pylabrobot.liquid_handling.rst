pylabrobot.liquid_handling package
==================================

This package contains all APIs relevant to liquid handling.
.. See :doc:`Basic liquid handling </user_guide/basic>` for a simple example.

Machine control is split into two parts: backends and front ends. Backends are used to control the
machine, and front ends are used to interact with the backend. Front ends are designed to be
largely backend agnostic, and can be used with any backend, meaning programs using this API can
be run on practically all supported hardware.
