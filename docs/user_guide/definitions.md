# Definitions

We try to keep jargon to a minimum, but some terms are commonly used in lab automation speak/PLR docs. It is a form of tacit knowledge. In some cases it's best to accept the universally used terms and not reinvent the wheel with more descriptive/longer terms. In those cases, we help newcomers by defining those terms here.

| Term | Definition |
