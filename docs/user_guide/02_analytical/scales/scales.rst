Scales
======   

This section focuses on the practical bits you need to automate weighing:

- how to connect to the device (typically serial/USB-serial),
- how to tare/zero before measuring,
- how to read weight values (and, where supported, stable readings).

Each scale page documents any device-specific settings and limitations.
