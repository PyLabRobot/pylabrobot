Error Handling in PLR
=====================

Basic
-----

PyLabRobot is simply Python, as a result error handling can be done using standard Python error handling.
This means that you can use try/except blocks to catch errors and handle them as you see fit.

Advanced
--------

For (bio)wetlab automation error handling it can be useful to write more complex error handling code than a single try/except block.
