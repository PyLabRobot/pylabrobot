    "\n",
    "The Liconic STX line of automated incubators come in a variety of sizes including STX 1000, STX 500, STX 280, STX 220, STX 110, STX 44. Which corresponds to the number of plates each size can store using the standard 22 plate capacity cassettes/cartridges (plate height 17mm, 505mm total height.) There are other cassette size for plates height ranging from 5 to 104mm in height (higher plates = less number of plates storage capacity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Liconic STX line comes in a variety of climate control options including Ultra High Temp. (HTT), Incubator (IC), Dry Storage (DC2), Humid Cooler (HC), Humid Wide Range (HR), Dry Wide Range (DR2), Humidity Controlled (AR), Deep Freezer (DF) and Ultra Deep Freezer (UDF). Each have different ranges of temperatures and humidity control ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other accessories that can be included with the STX and can be utilized with this driver include N2 gassing, CO2 gassing, a Turn Station (rotation of plates 90 degrees on the transfer station), internal barcode scanners, a swap station (two transfer plate positions that can be rotated 180 degrees) and internal shaking. \n",

    " - Configure racks\n",
    " - Move plates in and out\n",

For the Liconic the LiconcBackend class is used with the COM port used for connection (in this case COM3) and the model needs to specified (in this case the STX 220 Humid Cooler, STX220_HC). If an internal barcode is installed the barcode_installed parameter is set to True and its COM port is also specified. These two parameters are optional so can be omitted for Liconics without an internal barcode scanner. \n",
