# Fans (Air Filtration Systems)

In PyLabRobot, fans refer to air filtration units that condition air within or around the deck to protect the sample from contamination.

Their main purpose is to maintain a clean environment for experiments by ensuring consistent airflow and particle removal, reducing risks from dust, aerosols, and microorganisms.
These systems are not primarily designed for operator safety; separate equipment like fume extractors or biosafety cabinets serves that role.

Common filter technologies include:

- **HEPA filters**: Capture ≥99.97% of airborne particles ≥0.3 µm, widely used to keep samples clean.

- **ULPA filters**: Capture even smaller particles for higher-level cleanroom requirements.

- **Activated carbon filters**: Remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and chemical fumes.

- **Prefilters**: Trap larger particles to extend the lifespan of HEPA/ULPA filters.
