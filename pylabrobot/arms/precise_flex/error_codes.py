    "description": """This error indicates a more severe instance of the condition signaled by the "Hard envelope error" (-3100).  Like the "Hard" error, this error indicates that there was a significant difference betortween an axis' commanded position and its actual position.  And, like the "Hard" error, this error is generated when the value of the "Position tracking error, mcnt" (DataID 12320) for an axis exceeds its "Hard envelope error limit, mcnt" (DataID 10303) for a sufficient period of time.


  However, the "Abnormal" error is generated in place of the "Hard" error when the command velocity is lower than 33% of the Manual mode speed limit (DataID 10209). So, the "Abnormal" error indicates that a significant position error occurred when an axis was not supposed to be moving fast.  This error normally indicates a collision occurred when the robot was moving at a slow speed or one of the following motor configuration parameters are incorrect.

  Encoder sign (DataID 10202)
  Torque sign (DataID 10609)
  Commutation sign (DataID 10650)
  Hard envelope error (DataID 10303)
  Commutation offset (DataID 10775)

The motor is immediately shut down and an error is signaled.

  Since a BLDC motor cannot generate torque if the commutation angle is not properly set and cannot rotate unless the commutation angle is properly advanced, this check provides a low level independent test to ensure that a motor is not rotating faster than permitted. This is sometimes referred to as an independent "Velocity Restrict" test.

  This error will only be reported in controllers with FPGA firmware that supports CAT-3 safety capability, and the CAT-3 safety feature is enabled in software.

  This error may indicate that:

  DataIDs 10208/10209 are set too low
  An application program is trying to drive the motor faster than allowed
  An encoder read error has occurred due to noise on the encoder lines or bad data has been sent by an encoder. For non-CAT-3 systems, these types of errors typically generate "Encoder data or accel/decel limit errors" (-3134) or "Encoder operation errors" (-3126) or "Encoder communication errors" (-3140).
  A system hardware failure or a system software error has occurred that attempted to drive the motor faster than allowed.""",
