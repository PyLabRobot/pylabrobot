  We have some "phantom" resources that have a name and creator function, but are missing some

  incomplete.

  This error is raised when you try to create a resource like that. Please create a PR to list the
  resource catalog number (or equivalent), or measure and contribute the missing information. Please
  create an issue if you need help with this.
